GENERAL
Main concepts
The solution provided to the propfirm is structured by the following components:
• User Dashboard: propfirm’s customers can login on this portal in order to see their metrics,
open orders/positions, trading report and platforms(if applicable)
• Admin Dashboard: propfirm’s managers has access to this area and it can be used for the
following purposes:
o customer support: admins can access to all information about accounts, historical
orders, historical trades and so on
o management: creation of user, trading rule and so on
• APIs:
o Rest API: they are used in order to manage different entities, like: User, Group
Universes, Trading Rules, Subscriptions and Trading Accounts.
o Webhooks: enabled on request and they allows the propfirm to get notified on real
time when there are some changes/events on the following entities:
 Accounts: Creation, Snapshot updates and status changes
 Positions: Overnight
 Subscriptions: Creation, Sign of the agreement (NO_PRO / PRO), changes of
status
 Report of a trade closed
• Important: all entities can be created, edited and deleted both from API and admin
dashboard. Furthermore all the information available on user’s dashboard are available also
through API. It is care of the propfirm understanding what it is better to integrate on their
side through API or in which scenarios it is better to use our portal.
Architecture
We provide to the propfirm two different environments:
• staging: used for testing and development purposes. Users and accounts created on this
environment are free of charge
• production: used for real users and accounts
ENTITIES
Organization users
On the system there is a distinguish between normal users(customers) and propfirm’s employess or
managers. The second one can be divided into the following roles:
• viewer: readonly user
• manager: can see accounts details and eventually close orders and positions
• administrator: full control on symbols, users, rules and so on
When a new account is bought on propfirm’s side, the first step to create is an organization user,
since the trading accounts must be attached to a specific organization user.
Organization users can have two different management mode. Dedicated management mode is not
enabled as default and it may have an extra cost since it allows more management, iframes view and
so on.
Version 1.0 – 06/15/2025 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
• Shared: users have only one credential on VolumetricaFX system which is used to join / link
several and different organizations. In this scenario, the organization generates an invitation
url to join its organization.
• Dedicated: organization is entitled to create a specific user which will only have the accounts
of its organization. In this scenario, a random username will be generated and should be
sent to the user in order to access the dashboard and the platform. Furthermore, Propfirm
can also set a specific password on user creation if wanted, otherwise a random password
will be generated
Trading Accounts
Users can potentially have an unlimited number of accounts and we categorize the accounts on
different mode (both for billing and also for an architecture prospective):
• Evaluations (mode 0): it is usually the evaluation account
• SimFunded (mode 1 ) / Funded (mode 2): it is the sim funded account where user trades in a
SIM environment, but he is eligible for payouts
• Live (mode 3): it is a live account connected to a broker where user trades with live money
• Trial (mode 4): trial account, if agreed, it can be used for demo purposes
• Contest (mode 5): contest account, it is the account to make contests. We need to
categorize it since they usually have a different billing
• Training (mode 100): reserved mode, all users are automatically provided with a training
account where they can set custom balances, reset it and so on. It used to both test / learn
the platform and also to improve personal trading skills. It is free of charge.
During its lifetime, the account can have the following status values:
• Initialized = Account is created, but not enabled yet. Account can persist this status if it has
been setted a delayed start (not common used)
• Enabled = Account is enabled and ready for trading
• Challenge Success = if enabled on the risk/rule parameters, it means that the user has reach
the run-up/profit target
• Challenge Failed = = if enabled on the risk/rule parameters, it means that user has breached
one of the risk params like for example intraday drawdown, drawdown and so on
• Disabled = The account has been manually disabled by API or propfirm’s admins
Risk parameters for the account are managed by the trading rule(we see it on details later).
When an account is created, it can be decided to set a dedicated trading rule(account level) with a
custom drawdown and so on, or it can be used a trading rule globally defined. What it is best to use,
it depends on case by case. One thing to note is that, if a global trading rule is used, any changes to
that rule will affect ALL the accounts associated on real time.
RISK PARAMETERS
Symbols
By default, the solution is provided by a preset of symbols available with default margins, spreads,
commissions and leverage that an account can open.
For symbol management, propfirms have different possibilities:
• changes margins and commission for all account, editing them on symbol’s admin page
• use custom margins and commissions for specific trading rule or limit the symbols available:
this can be done using the “Group universe” function
Version 1.0 – 06/15/2025 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Group Universes
Propfirm can create several different group universes, which overrides the list of symbol available
for the accounts with custom margins and symbols.
Groups universes can be linked to many trading rules, so it means that the relationship is 1-N.
The use of group universes is not a requirement, since trading rule can also be created without any
group universe associated, but it is strongly recommended to handle margins and specific leverage
based on the product type.
Trading Rules
As written before, trading rules can be both global defined or defined on the account level. It is the
entity which controls all the risk parameters for the accounts, in particular:
• Maximum Drawdown
• Run-up / Profit target
• Intraday Drawdown
• Intraday Runup
• Maximum position loss
• Maximum position gain
• Max portfolio loss
• Max portfolio gain
• Maximum daily number of trades
• Various: minimum session numbers, overnight and overweek allowed and so on
Each of the previous params can have different settings, both in term of enable or disable, values
and anchor mode, but there are some common terms which have sense to explain:
• Balance: it is the closed balance of the account, so it means that it does NOT include
floating/open PnL
• Equity: it is the floating balance of the account, which includes open positions
Actions available:
• None: the risk param is not enabled for the account
• Challenge fail: if triggered, the account is immediately disabled
• Flat: all open positions are flatted, but account keeps active
• Intraday disable: all open positions are flatted, the account is disabled for the CURRENT
trading session. User will be able to trade again when next session opens
Values – it can be defined both or either a money amount or a % amount and it is possible to
decide(selection) which of them should be used for risk evaluation
Trading rules are cyclically checked for each account with a very low frequency in order to disable
the accounts that goes outside the defined risk params.
ADMIN DASHBOARD
Beyond the management of the entities, admins can access to all account information, which
includes:
• realtime updates of accounts balance
• view of open orders and positions of specific account
• list of the historical trade for manual check of consistency or similar things
Version 1.0 – 06/15/2025 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
• list of the historical orders which includes the source IPs, platform and date/time. It is useful
for tickets management
Furthermore, it is available a monitor page, where propfirm can see the list of all their accounts,
filtered by specific trading rule, with realtime updates of balances, equities, open trades and so on.
API
Rest API
Swagger Docs. It contains also parameters details:
https://staging-api.volumetricafx.com/swagger/index.html
All the request must be executed as follow and the result is on json format:
o Endpoint:
o Staging: https://staging- api.volumetricafx.com/api/v2/propsite
o Production: https://api.volumetricafx.com/api/v2/propsite
o It must be included this header in the request:
o x-api-key = token provided by email
o All responses message are wrapped in the following object:
o success: bool
o data: object - if successful (200 Status code) and expected for the API, it contains the
object/entity
o statusCode: int – sent only if unsuccessful (status code different to 200)
o message: string - sent only if unsuccessful
o details: list of string – sent only if unsuccessful, it provides extra details
On swagger there are descriptions of different endpoints available with also the description of the
various params. If more details are required, feel free to reach us so we can help you and support
the integration.
On this document, we analyze only the most important APIs available:
• User:
o Dedicated user management endpoints
 Creation - /user (POST):
• It must be provided all the user details(name, surname and so on).
They are needed for market data agreements as explained before
• Parameters:
o “encryptionMode”
– if password is encrypted on API
exchanges:
 0 = None encryption
 1 = AES_256 encryption – key is provided via mail
o “forceNewPassword”: it is setted at false by default. A
password is ALWAYS generated if the user is new. It may be
setted to true if it is required a new password on user
update
• Returns:
o “userId:” it must be stored on the propfirm’s DB because it
is necessary for the next calls
Version 1.0 – 06/15/2025 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
o password: it contains the password just created. It is
encrypted with the same approach of “encryptionMode”
• IMPORTANT: each propfirm can decide if they want to send the
login credentials via email to the user or not. Two different
approaches can be used:
o Propfirm stores the users’ passwords on its database and it
shows them in its dashboard
o Password is sent via email from our backend to each user
and the propfirm doesn’t need to store them.
 /user/loginurl (POST): it can be used to generate a OTP url, which redirects
the user to our dashboard. In this case, the user will be automatically logged
in. It can be useful for putting a button on propfirm’s customer area
o Shared user management endpoint
 Generate invitation url - /user/invite (POST):
• It is required to provide the country and it is suggested to send also
an externalId, which is an id on your side in order to avoid to
generate more invite for the same user on your side
• Returns:
o “userId:” it must be stored on the propfirm’s DB because it
is necessary for the next calls
o status: the status of the invitation
o inviteUrl: this is the url generated which should be either
send or displayed somewhere on your dashboard in order to
allow user to join the organization
o IFrame available:
 Dedicated user management only:
• /VolumetricaWebApp (most used): it generates an url which can be
embedded in an iframe and shows the web trading terminal. This is
a nice feature if you want to allow the user to directly trade from
your dashboard without the need to login in any other portal
• /iframe: it generates an iframe of the trading dashboard which can
be embedded. It shows on realtime orders, positions, balance
information and so on
• /iframePortfolio: it generates iframe which shows only the positions
and orders widget (always updated on realtime)
• Trading Accounts:
o /tradingAccount (GET):
 it returns the real time information for the trading account. Look at swagger
for field available, they should be intuitive
o /tradingAccount (POST):
 it creates a new trading account.
 Params that need an extra explanation:
• “userId”: it is the id returned on the user creation
• “currency”:
o 0 = EUR
o 1 = USD (we suggest to use this)

o Evaluations (mode 0): it is usually the evaluation account
Version 1.0 – 06/15/2025 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
o SimFunded (mode 1 ) / Funded (mode 2): it is the sim
funded account where user trades in a SIM environment,
but he is eligible for payouts
o Live (mode 3): it is a live account connected to a broker
where user trades with live money
o Trial (mode 4): trial account, if agreed, it can be used for
demo purposes
o Contest (mode 5): contest account, it is the account to make
contests. We need to categorize it since they usually have a
different billing
o Training (mode 100): reserved mode, all users are
automatically provided with a training account where they
can set custom balances, reset it and so on. It used to both
test / learn the platform and also to improve personal
trading skills. It is free of charge.
• “portfolioMode”:
o 0 = Netting mode
o 1 = Heding mode
• “header”: default is header is something like: DFX-CUM_NUMBER.
Setting this field, it can be overridden.
• “description”: custom description that it will be shown on the
dashboard
• “disableOtherAccountsEnabled”: if true – it disables all the other
account enabled
• Account expirations:
o “expirationMode”:
 0 = never expires
 1 = use “endDate” sent
 2 = use “expirationDays” and it adds them from
activation date/time
 3 = use “expirationDays” and it adds them from the
first order inserted date/time
 4 = use “expirationDays” and it adds them from the
first order executed date/time
• Trading rules:
o Global level: it must be setted the “accountRuleId” param
o Account level: it must me populated “accountCustomRule”,
setting all the parameters

Webhooks
We strictly suggest the integration of webhooks technology, because it both helps propfirm to get
notified on realtime when something happens and our resources to have a lower overhead
compared to polling all the accounts to get changes.
The architecture is structured to be consistent, which means that failed webhooks are sent until we
do not receive an HTTP 200 status code, so couple of considerations:
• you do not have any risk of loosing information during update or downtime
• they are sent sequentially in order to rebuild the changes of status in a chronological order
• if you have revieved the request, please always answer 200 OK, even if some exceptions are
thrown, otherwise all other webhooks are blocked
Propfirm should provide an url endpoint where they can receive the HTTP requests. Requests will be
sent using the following token:
• x-api-key: token provided via email. Usually it is the same of token used for Rest API
requests
At the moment, they are available the following categories of notifications:
• 0 = Accounts:
o Events available:
 0 = Created
 1 = Update – it can be configured to receive the following updates:
• account status changes: it is enabled by default. It is sent a
notification for example when an account switches from “Enable” to
“Challenge failed”
• balance changes: it can be enabled on request, an event it is sent
each time that a transaction is closed on the account
 2 = Delete
• 1 = Positions
o Events available:
Version 1.0 – 06/15/2025 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
 3 = Overnight: it notifies overnight positions for the account. Some propfirm
do not want to disable account as default on overnight, but managed it on
their side
• 3 = Trade Report – it notifies an close transaction with PnL informations
o it is enabled on request
o Events available:
 0 = Created
• 5 = Organization User – it notifies when a user organization status changed. For example
when the user accepts the invite to join the organization
For development or debug, propfirm’s admins can see webhook generated on the admin portal with
also the JSON body generated.
If you need some examples for specific situations, please directly ask us and we will provide JSON
payloads example.
Last thing: on swagger there is an endpoint which allows you to see what it is received through
webhook, in particular: /webhook/GetModel
